TO RUN:
Download all files, open folder in VS Code, Right click index.html, and select 'Open with Live Server'
If Live Server option does not exist, install the Live Server extension in the Extenstions tab of VS Code and then open index.html with Live Server
After opening with Live Server, it is normal for the page to be frozen/unresponsive for a bit; it takes time to parse and load the data in. Wait a few moments and it's all good :)
